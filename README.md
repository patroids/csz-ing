CSZ-ing: an Ionic App
=====================

This app is for beginner-to-proficient level Chinese (Mandarin) speakers who have difficulties remembering the pinyin for commonly used words. These are words starting with c, s and z, versus those starting with ch, sh and zh. It also contains a guide for pinyin ending with "-in" versus "-ing". 

This is not meant for those who do not know Chinese.

## Using this project

This app was built using the Ionic Framework. Feel free to download and edit.

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) repo.
